When speaking of the command line, what we really mean is the **shell**. It's a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the OS kernel to carry out.

To signal that the shell is ready to accept commands, it shows a *prompt* in the form of a `$`. If the prompt is a `#`, that means the user has superuser privileges.

#### Commands
Commands are often followed by one or more options that modify their behavior, and by one or more arguments upon which the command acts.
```
command -options arguments
```

Arguments can either be short, `-l` or long `--long`
